## About

LucimaTools is an open-source project built to reduce the daily grind for *Ark Re:Code* players. It uses the game's lower-level interactions to provide a headless framework that can execute tasks without running the game client. On either supported platform, LucimaTools offers ready-to-use automation so you can spend less time on repetitive chores and more time on team building, chatting with the community, or being with the people who matter.

## Features

**Automated tasks** (run on schedule)
- Base rewards (power conversion / growth potions / star-up crystals / skill modules)
- Dispatch missions
- Free Secret Shop refreshes
- Daily free recruitment
- Virtual Illusion
- Arena NPC battles

**Manual tasks**
- Claim all mail
- Secret Shop refreshes using diamonds
- Hunt / element / event stages
- Store purchases

> More tasks are in development.

## Quick Start

Download the release for your platform and run it directly.

Your password is used only to obtain a login token and is never stored on disk. The token is
protected by Windows DPAPI or Android Keystore. After a restart, choose the saved account from
the account dropdown and click Login to restore the session without entering the password again.

### Developer Build

The project uses Python 3.12. The Windows desktop build also requires the system Edge / WebView2 runtime; Android builds require JDK 17, the Android SDK, and NDK 26. Installing dependencies in a virtual environment is recommended:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install PyInstaller before packaging the Windows build. The scripts in the repository root can build either platform or both:

```powershell
python -m pip install pyinstaller==6.20.0
.\build.bat win       # Windows desktop app
.\build.bat android   # Android debug APK
.\build.bat all       # Build both platforms
```

Build outputs:

- Windows: `dist/LucimaTools/`
- Android: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

Android falls back to debug signing when no signing configuration is present. For a release signature, create a local `keystore.properties` from `android/keystore.properties.example`. Change the application version only through `APP_VERSION` in `backend/version.py`. After updating the external resource archive, run `python tools/sync_assets.py` to regenerate the `assets/` directory included in the repository and application packages.

> Rebuilding the Windows package clears `dist/LucimaTools/`. Back up `settings.json` and other user data stored there first.
